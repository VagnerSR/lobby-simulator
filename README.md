# Lobby Simulator

[Link to the project](https://lobby-simulator.vercel.app/)


It all started with my friends and I joking about our skills (or lack thereof) and how we seem to spend more time in the lobby than actually playing the game. 
That's what sparked the idea behind this project!

## Introduction

Lobby Simulator is a chat application designed to replicate the lobby environment commonly found in multiplayer games. 
It allows users to connect, chat, and share their gaming anecdotes while waiting for the actual gameplay to begin. 
Once you step into the lobby, you'll se a display "Looking for Players" message until the lobby reaches its maximum capacity of 6 people.
At that point, the queue starts searching for a game to join, but it never actually finds a match. When the queue reaches five minutes it 
will show a message "Something went wrong" and a button to restart the queue.
